This is a script i wrote so i can follow the sprea of covid19 in my country on my statusbar
so someone else won't have to bother writing one.
To install it just make the scripts executables and move the corona file to /usr/bin (you'll need to be 
sudo).Run the Genfile in order to make a cache otherwise it won't work.
The default country is Italy.You can edit the genfie yourself to change it or you can
run "corona changecountry" once you move the "corona" file to /usr/bin to change it.This 
will work even when the bar is running .
I could not make the script without https://github.com/sagarkarira/coronavirus-tracker-cli/
wich is more useful to people in general and i recommend checking it out.
I also have an example config for i3blocks.
Also I'm sorry for piping so much i'm a begginer at shell scripting.
